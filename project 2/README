Part 1 Questions: 
Why did you choose this sub-community? 
We chose the community within hacked because it is a niche yet growing community at Friends, where members are passionate about coding, tech and problem solving. As a group who is interested in tech and coding, especially as this is a project for CS III, we were curious about their academic performance and study habits. 

How did you communicate this project to them? 
We introduced the project to them during a hacked meeting and individually whenever we saw them. We then asked them the questions in person, took notes and then added them to trello. 

Did your findings meet any preconceived notions or contradict your predictions? How/Why? Refer to at least one of max/min/average from Part 3. 
The average focus level while studying was 6.3/10. This finding met our preconceived notion that it would be around 6/10, the average focus level of a highschooler while studying.
